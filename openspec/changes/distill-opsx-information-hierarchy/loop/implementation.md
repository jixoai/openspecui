Orthogonal intents (created 2026-07-28 Asia/Shanghai):
1. Synchronize implementation reality with the approved distillation plan.
2. Record production-owner decisions and focused evidence.
3. Preserve divergence and loopback triggers without rewriting history.

Original request (2026-07-28): implement the information-hierarchy optimization, then hand final acceptance to the Owner.
-->

## Implementation State

Status: **apply-ready; specification complete and production code not yet changed**.

```text
spec artifacts -> shared primitives -> owner groups -> focused evidence -> delivery -> owner acceptance
```

The beta release preceding this Change completed as `6.0.0-beta.1`; package publication is not part of this
Change.

## Decisions Taken

- Presentation primitives remain subscription-free and mutation-free.
- `InformationBadge` is the Tier 2 status carrier; it must be keyboard-focusable and Tooltip-attributed.
- `EvidenceDisclosure` is the Tier 3 owner; it uses the installed Base UI Accordion primitive.
- Errors, stale authority, blocked actions, and destructive consequences remain Tier 1 direct content.
- Existing route/subscription/mutation owners remain intact; this is a presentation architecture change.
- The `opsx-ui-views` delta and canonical Chinese terminology encode the three-tier hierarchy; strict OpenSpec
  validation passes.

## Divergence Notes

- None.

## Loopback Triggers

- A required failure becomes reachable only by opening an Accordion or focusing a Tooltip.
- A route needs new backend data or a parallel health inference to produce its summary.
- Static and live projections require different presentation semantics for the same fact.
- A shared primitive grows subscription, routing, or mutation ownership.
- Focused tests cannot distinguish direct blocker content from collapsed evidence.
