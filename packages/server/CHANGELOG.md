# @openspecui/server

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 67d7d16: Finalize the dashboard live workflow iteration with stronger operational context and static parity:
  - redesign Dashboard top section into objective `Workflow Progress` + `Git Snapshot`
  - add git snapshot model/refresh lifecycle and compact diff-focused rendering
  - harden objective trend windowing and availability semantics
  - archive and sync the `dashboard-live-workflow-status` OpenSpec change artifacts
  - export and consume OpenSpecUI config in static snapshots for consistent Settings/Dashboard behavior

### Patch Changes

- a29c5a8: Improve dashboard with a new objective overview data model and reactive subscription:
  - add backend `dashboard` get/subscribe API
  - include spec/requirement counts and active/completed/in-progress change metrics
  - show per-spec requirement breakdown and per-change task progress in UI
  - support static export mode via dashboard overview mapping

- Updated dependencies [67d7d16]
- Updated dependencies [a29c5a8]
  - @openspecui/core@1.5.0

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 991caa1: Use `tsconfig.check.json` for server typecheck so workspace path aliases resolve in CI without requiring prebuilt dependency artifacts.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a full pop-area based `/opsx:new` creation flow and unify terminal close lifecycle with callback metadata.
  - Replace dashboard/changes prompt-based creation with `/_p=/opsx-new` workflow UI.
  - Add advanced argument chips on `/opsx-new` while keeping official `new change` flags.
  - Extend PTY create/list protocol with `closeTip` and `closeCallbackUrl` metadata.
  - Execute close callbacks from a single terminal close path after process exit (internal route push or external URL open).
  - Add tests for new pop route mapping, command assembly, and terminal close callback behavior.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @openspecui/core@1.2.0

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Refactor OPSX config data flow to use a single `configBundle` subscription path.
  - unify config/schemas page schema metadata loading through one reactive bundle
  - remove deprecated split schema subscriptions from server and web hooks
  - optimize kernel-backed read lifecycle for faster first paint in config views

- Updated dependencies
  - @openspecui/core@1.1.2

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Release a minor version focused on platform reliability and search/productivity upgrades:
  - Add reactive search architecture with shared provider-based search engine and pop-area search UX.
  - Improve pop dialog lifecycle to make open/close behavior deterministic across routes and interactions.
  - Enhance CLI execution-path detection/config flow and related runtime diagnostics.
  - Improve terminal/session behavior and cross-platform compatibility, including Windows execution fixes.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @openspecui/core@1.1.0
  - @openspecui/search@1.1.0

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 74afc3f: Improve CLI configuration initialization and developer workflow stability.
  - Fix config persistence bootstrap by creating `openspec/` before writing `.openspecui.json`, so missing project config paths are no longer misreported as CLI-unavailable errors.
  - Improve dev workflow with a Bun/OpenTUI multi-tab `pnpm dev` experience and terminal rendering pipeline upgrades for PTY-style output, color-preserving display, and more reliable task lifecycle handling.
  - Fix Windows PTY startup defaults by resolving shell command from `ComSpec` (fallback to `cmd.exe`) instead of unix-only `/bin/sh`, and return structured `PTY_CREATE_FAILED` errors when PTY session creation fails.

- Updated dependencies [74afc3f]
  - @openspecui/core@1.0.4

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 74afc3f: Improve CLI configuration initialization and developer workflow stability.
  - Fix config persistence bootstrap by creating `openspec/` before writing `.openspecui.json`, so missing project config paths are no longer misreported as CLI-unavailable errors.
  - Improve dev workflow with a Bun/OpenTUI multi-tab `pnpm dev` experience and terminal rendering pipeline upgrades for PTY-style output, color-preserving display, and more reliable task lifecycle handling.

- Updated dependencies [74afc3f]
  - @openspecui/core@1.0.3

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Improve CLI configuration reliability and in-app recovery flow.
  - Add strict `execute-path` behavior: when user-configured, it is used as the only runner candidate (no implicit fallback), so invalid paths are surfaced immediately.
  - Improve command parsing for `execute-path` with robust quoted/Windows-path handling and `command + args` persistence.
  - Unify config write path on `config.update`, keep `config.subscribe` as the single reactive config stream, and fix reactive config push after writes.
  - Upgrade the `OpenSpec CLI Required` modal to support inline `execute-path` input/save/recheck and auto-close on successful availability checks.
  - Improve dev workflow so root `pnpm dev` also watches and rebuilds `@openspecui/core`, with server dev watching core dist changes.

- Updated dependencies
  - @openspecui/core@1.0.2
