Improve dashboard and schema workflows with better static/live parity.

- enhance dashboard cards and historical trend plumbing with git-backed static data mapping
- improve schema file explorer interactions: robust context-menu anchoring, read-mode properties action, and mobile current-file menu
- improve static export UX and path display mapping, including project/npm scoped display paths
- add safer CLI export package resolution behavior and test coverage for local/dev package ranges
