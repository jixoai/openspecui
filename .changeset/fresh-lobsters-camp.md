Finalize the dashboard live workflow iteration with stronger operational context and static parity:

- redesign Dashboard top section into objective `Workflow Progress` + `Git Snapshot`
- add git snapshot model/refresh lifecycle and compact diff-focused rendering
- harden objective trend windowing and availability semantics
- archive and sync the `dashboard-live-workflow-status` OpenSpec change artifacts
- export and consume OpenSpecUI config in static snapshots for consistent Settings/Dashboard behavior
